## Running the Website Locally

To run the website locally using MAMP, a free local server environment, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download MAMP

1. Download MAMP from the official website: [MAMP Downloads](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/).
2. Follow the installation instructions to install MAMP on your machine.

### Step 2: Configure MAMP

1. Open MAMP from your Applications folder.
2. In the MAMP window, click on `Preferences`.
3. Navigate to the `Web Server` tab:
   - Click on the folder icon next to `Document Root` and select the directory where your repository files are located.
4. Go to the `Start/Stop` tab:
   - In the "My Favorite Link" field, type `/` to set the root directory as the favorite link.
5. Click `OK` to save your preferences.

### Step 3: Run the Server

1. Press `Start Servers` in the MAMP control panel. Wait until both Apache and MySQL servers are running (indicated by green lights).
2. Once the servers are running, click `Open WebStart page` in the MAMP window.

### Step 4: Access the Website

1. The MAMP start page will open in your default browser. 
2. Click on `My Favorite Link` at the top of the MAMP start page, or manually navigate to [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) to access your site.

These steps will guide you through setting up and accessing the website locally on your computer.
